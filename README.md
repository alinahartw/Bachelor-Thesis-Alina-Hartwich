# Bachelor-Thesis-Alina-Hartwich

This is the supporting material for my Bachelor-Thesis.

In "multivariate ClaSP" you can find the adapted ClaSP algorithm, that is now able to segment univariate and multivariate TS. Furthermore, I have stored all my generated results here (for the Challenge Data Set and the MOSAD data set).

In "example_segmentation.py", you can find the code to segment a multivariate TS from the MOSAD data set.
